The consequence of this development is the increased exposure to cyber threats. This paper surveys the latest methodologies and research for measuring and managing this risk. A dearth of industrial-control-system-specific security metrics has been identified as a barrier to implementing these methodologies. Consequently, an agenda for future research on industrial control system security metrics is outlined. The “functional assurance” concept is also introduced to deal with fail-safe and fail-secure industrial control system operations.},

Cyber-physical production systems (CPPS), relying on the latest, and the foreseeable further developments of computer science, information and communication technologies on one hand, and of manufacturing science and technology, on the other, may lead to the 4th industrial revolution, frequently noted as Industrie 4.0. The paper underlines that there are significant roots in general – and in particular to the CIRP community – which point towards CPPS. Expectations towards research in and implementation of CPS and CPPS are outlined and some case studies are introduced. Related new R&D challenges are highlighted.},

Experts appreciate improvements in interdisciplinary collaboration, lead times and development costs by applying agile techniques as artifacts, meetings, roles and visualisation methods. Up to now, the use of agile procedures is still limited to IT-projects, due to a lack of profound knowledge in transferring agile techniques into interdisciplinary projects. This contribution presents the research work on Agile Engineering, a counterpart of Lean Product Development, by the systematic integration of agile techniques into the development process of mechatronic production systems. Thereto, an introduction and state of the art is given concerning the industry sector of machinery and plant construction as well as agile methodologies. The main focus of the paper is represented by the classification and comparison of Agile Engineering as well as the main features of integrating agile techniques into the mechatronic engineering process. According to the advanced research insights of the last years, Agile Engineering is a new enabler of success for establishing an agile production, providing promising approaches for coping with change and uncertainty efficiently.},

The security issue holds the key to its development for technology feature based on web service. In this paper, the OPC UA security issues are discussed from the two views of network environment security and communication security in OPC UA applications. The network security deployment solution based on distributed firewall was proposed to ensure the host of OPC UA server and client against the different attacks. Sequentially the improved OPC UA security model based on the existing model was presented. A security strategy management module was added into the model, by configuring the module, the security characteristic of OPC UA applications system can adapt to the different security level. At last the information model of the security model is designed. By the above means, the OPC UA communication security and communication efficiency can be balanced better, and it provides the guideline for the development of OPC UA server and the OPC UA applications.},

In this paper we present an innovative approach to the design of Intrusion Detection Systems. The aim is to be able to detect complex attacks to SCADA systems, by monitoring its state evolution. By complex attack, we mean attacks composed of a set of commands that, while licit when considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can disrupt the correct behavior of the system when executed in particular operating states. The proposed IDS detects these complex attacks thanks to an internal representation of the controlled SCADA system. We also present the corresponding rule language powerful enough to express the system's critical states. Furthermore, we present a prototype of the proposed IDS, able to monitor systems using the ModBus and DNP3 communication protocols.},

Among these systems, industrial control systems (ICS) operating on critical infrastructures have been proven to be an attractive target for attackers. The case of Stuxnet has not only showed that ICSs are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, but also that some of these attacks rely on understanding the processes beyond the employed systems and using such knowledge to maximize the damage. This concept is commonly known as "semantic attack". Our paper discusses a specific type of semantic attack involving "sequences of events". Common network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) generally search for single, unusual or "not permitted" operations. In our case, rather than a malicious event, we show how a specific series of "permitted" operations can elude standard intrusion detection systems and still damage an infrastructure. Moreover, we present a possible approach to the development of a sequence-aware intrusion detection system (S-IDS). We propose a S-IDS reference architecture and we discuss all the steps through its implementations. Finally, we test the S-IDS on real ICS traffic samples captured from a water treatment and purification facility.},

All too often, malicious intruders can hack into systems by exploiting software defects. Internet-enabled software applications present the most common security risk encountered today, with software's ever-expanding complexity and extensibility adding further fuel to the fire. By any measure, security holes in software are common, and the problem is growing.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an approach enabling economic modelling of information security risk management in contemporaneous businesses and other organizations. In the world of permanent cyber attacks to ICT systems, risk management is becoming a crucial task for minimization of the potential risks that can endeavor their operation. The prevention of the heavy losses that may happen due to cyber attacks and other information system failures in an organization is usually associated with continuous investment in different security measures and purchase of data protection systems. With the rise of the potential risks the investment in security services and data protection is growing and is becoming a serious economic issue to many organizations and enterprises. This paper analyzes several approaches enabling assessment of the necessary investment in security technology from the economic point of view. The paper introduces methods for identification of the assets, the threats, the vulnerabilities of the ICT systems and proposes a procedure that enables selection of the optimal investment of the necessary security technology based on the quantification of the values of the protected systems. The possibility of using the approach for an external insurance based on the quantified risk analyses is also provided.},

The analysis considers threat likelihood, the cost of security measures, hazard likelihood, risk reduction and expected losses to compare the costs and benefits of security measures to decide the optimal security measures to airports. Monte-Carlo simulation methods were used to propagate hazard likelihood, risk reduction and loss uncertainties in the calculation of net benefits that also allows probability of cost-effectiveness to be calculated. It is found that attack probabilities had to be much higher than currently observed to justify additional protective measures. Overall, then, it is questionable whether special efforts to further protect airports are sensible expenditures. Indeed, some relaxation of the measures already in place may well be justified.},

  Abstract                 = {Within the last decade, Security became a major focus in the traditional IT-Industry, mainly through the interconnection of systems and especially through the connection to the Internet. This opened up a huge new attack surface, which resulted in major takedowns of legitimate services and new forms of crime and destruction. This led to the development of a multitude of new defense mechanisms and strategies, as well as the establishing of Security procedures on both, organizational and technical level. Production systems have mostly remained in isolation during these past years, with security typically focused on the perimeter. Now, with the introduction of new paradigms like Industry 4.0, this isolation is questioned heavily with Physical Production Systems (PPSs) now connected to an IT-world resulting in cyber-physical systems sharing the attack surface of traditional web based interfaces while featuring completely different goals, parameters like lifetime and safety, as well as construction. In this work, we present an outline on the major security challenges faced by cyber-physical production systems. While many of these challenges harken back to issues also present in traditional web based IT, we will thoroughly analyze the differences. Still, many new attack vectors appeared in the past, either in practical attacks like Stuxnet, or in theoretical work. These attack vectors use specific features or design elements of cyber-physical systems to their advantage and are unparalleled in traditional IT. Furthermore, many mitigation strategies prevalent in traditional IT systems are not applicable in the industrial world, e.g., patching, thus rendering traditional strategies in IT-Security unfeasible. A thorough discussion of the major challenges in CPPS-Security is thus required in order to focus research on the most important targets.},

Our findings emphasise the distinct characteristics of cyber risks compared with other operational risks and bring to light significant problems resulting from highly interrelated losses, lack of data and severe information asymmetries. These problems hinder the development of a sustainable cyber insurance market.

Still, major mitigation strategies known from the traditional IT-world are not sufficient for industrial environments. In this work, we therefore provide an analysis of the situation starting with major changes in the industrial world by introducing networking equipment that create important security challenges for the future. Based on the identified research needs we will outline how to address them in future.
